## Technical Implementation

### Context Management
The app uses React Context to manage global state:
- **Camera Mode**: Switches between 'AUDIO' and 'VIDEO'
- **Recording State**: Tracks recording status and timer
- **Shared State**: Accessible across all tabs and components

### Dynamic Tab Bar
The tab bar styling changes based on the current mode:

```typescript
// In VIDEO mode
tabBarStyle: {
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',
  position: 'absolute',
  // Overlaid on camera
}

// In AUDIO mode  
tabBarStyle: {
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)',
  // Standard tab bar positioning
}
```

### Camera Implementation
- Uses `expo-camera` for camera functionality
- Handles permissions and camera switching
- Full-screen camera view with overlay controls
- Recording timer with formatted display (MM:SS)

### Mode-Specific Layouts
- **VIDEO Mode**: Full-screen camera with transparent overlays
- **AUDIO Mode**: Camera with black bars (letterbox effect)
- Automatic mode switching when navigating between tabs

## Key Components

### CameraModeContext
Provides global state management for:
- Current camera mode (AUDIO/VIDEO)
- Recording status and timer
- Mode switching functionality

### Tab Layout
Dynamic tab bar that:
- Changes transparency based on mode
- Adjusts positioning for overlay effect
- Maintains consistent navigation

### Video Screen (Main Camera)
Full-featured camera interface with:
- Recording controls and timer
- Camera flip functionality
- Zoom controls and grid overlay
- Mode switching UI
- Professional camera controls

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Camera Permissions**
   The app will request camera permissions on first launch.
